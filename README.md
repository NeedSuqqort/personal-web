# NeedSupport's Personal Website (PWA)

This is the repository of my personal website.

It is a progressive web application (PWA) as a record of my learning progress in web development.

To view this app locally, run the following commands after clone:

    npm install
    npm run dev

To run this app as a PWA, run the following commands after clone:

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run preview

Run this before pushing (prettier to format the code)

    npx prettier . --write

# There might be some other features in the future
